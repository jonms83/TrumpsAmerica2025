In fact, he said, farmers were counting on that water to be available for summer irrigation.  “This is going to hurt farmers,” Vink said. “This takes water out of their summer irrigation portfolio.” ",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-31/trump-california-dams-opened-up?utm_source=reddit.com,,,

theholyraptor
This isn't a singular freak accident. The airport is running at 120% capacity and fed helo ops are allowed ridiculously close. Congress debated this and ignored the politicians of this area who were concerned about the high use and safety. A compromise was proposed and Cruz killed it.
Also why do congested helo ops use different frequency radio systems than part 121 aircraft?
Now does all the bullshit in ops post about Trumps post-inaugeration antics directly relate? No. Will this be the last straw that forces good change? I doubt it especially with this admin who is vocal about cutting funding for groups that already need more staffing.

Let's be better than this. An advisory committee ended last week did not result in any changes to ATC staffing this week. I wouldn't say anything, but I've seen a lot of unsupported headlines and posts since his orangeness's return. We're not helping the cause by making stuff up.
