603,2/14/2025,We can no longer trust America - The Hill Times,"Excerpts:   A growing number of commentators are beginning to say that a coup is in fact underway in the U.S., spearheaded by the world’s richest man and the world’s biggest ego.  Unless governments realize that Trump in office is just part two of the Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt at the Capitol, the temptation will be to appease him.  Nothing could be worse than going along to get along with a person who is inherently dishonest, untrustworthy, and determined to bend everyone to his will by sheer bullying and aggression.  Canada can never again assume that America is our devoted friend who will look out for our interests or appreciate our friendship. It’s time to strengthen our country from within, and reach out to countries who, like us, can no longer count on a world order run by America.

520,2/10/2025,[VIDEO] FBI agent writes anonymous letter warning Americans," Here's the letter:

Uncommon Sense was a Common Vice

Those with knowledge of the United States Marine Corps will recognize the irony of this title. I wish its words were not true, but as I write this, I believe they are.

Currently, there is an effort to cull a significant number of career Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is an unthinkable action that will gravely undermine the security of the nation well beyond what many of our citizens are aware. For those seeking to raise their awareness, I offer this vignette, free of political bias or moral judgment. It is not about any one person, but an amalgamation of multiple FBI Special Agents.

I am the coach of your child’s soccer team. I sit next to you on occasion in religious devotion. I am a member of the PTA. With friends, you celebrated my birthday. I collected your mail and took out your trash while you were away from home. I played a round of golf with you. I am a veteran. I am the average neighbor in your community. This is who you see and know. However, there is a part of my life that is a mystery to you, and prompts a natural curiosity about my profession.

This is the quiet side of me that you do not know: I orchestrated a clandestine operation to secure the release of an allied soldier held captive by the Taliban. I prevented an ISIS terrorist from boarding a commercial aircraft. I spent 3 months listening to phone intercepts in real time to gather evidence needed to dismantle a violent drug gang. I recruited a source to provide critical intelligence on Russian military activities in Africa. I rescued a citizen being tortured to near death by members of an Outlaw Motorcycle Gang. I interceded and stopped a juvenile planning to conduct a school shooting. I spent multiple years monitoring the activities of deep cover foreign intelligence officers, leading to their arrest and deportation. I endured extensive hardship to infiltrate a global child trafficking organization. I have been shot in the line of duty.

Something else about me, I was assigned to investigate a potential crime. Like all previous cases I have investigated, this one met every legal standard of predication and procedure. Without bias, I upheld my oath to this country and the Constitution and collected the facts. I collected the facts in a manner to neither prove innocence nor guilt, but to arrive at resolution.

I am now sitting in my home, listening to my children play and laugh in the backyard, oblivious to the prospect that their father may be fired in a few days. Fired for conducting a legally authorized investigation. Fired for doing the job that he was hired to do. I have to wonder, when I am gone, who will do the quiet work that is behind the facade of your average neighbor? .

Establishment of DOGE Teams: In consultation with the USDS Administrator, each Agency Head is to establish a DOGE Team within their respective agencies. These teams, typically comprising a lead, an engineer, a human resources specialist, and an attorney, are tasked with coordinating efforts to advance the DOGE Agenda.  #  4. Access to Agency Resources: Ensuring that the USDS has full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems to facilitate the modernization initiatives.  #  These responsibilities position the USDS Administrator at the forefront of efforts to streamline and enhance the efficiency of federal government operations through technological modernization.

This isn't a singular freak accident. The airport is running at 120% capacity and fed helo ops are allowed ridiculously close. Congress debated this and ignored the politicians of this area who were concerned about the high use and safety. A compromise was proposed and Cruz killed it.
Also why do congested helo ops use different frequency radio systems than part 121 aircraft?
Now does all the bullshit in ops post about Trumps post-inaugeration antics directly relate? No. Will this be the last straw that forces good change? I doubt it especially with this admin who is vocal about cutting funding for groups that already need more staffing.
